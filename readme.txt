A WordPress plugin to manage your CCG collection

== Description ==

CCG Manager is a way to store your collectable card game trading cards in WordPress. It's based off of desktop apps like Magic Suitcase which store your card collections and allow you to search through your inventory. 

Using custom post types and taxonomies, you can store information about your cards, sort them by series, and split them into collections. Collections could be based on whatever criteria you like -- some examples could be to split them by game, decks, etc.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my collection(s) on my site? =

I will be adding shortcodes to upcoming updates which will allow you to display your card lists and single cards.

= How should I enter color-based costs (mana colors (MtG), energy colors (Pokemon), etc.)? =

The proper syntax is to use the letter for the mana/energy/whatever card used. So a MtG card that costs 2 colorless and 2 white would be written out like this:

2WW

This is so, in a future add-on for that CCG, I can replace the letter for the cost with an icon image representing that color.

= I have ideas for future enhancements/I want to contribute to the development of the plugin. How do I get in touch? =

== Future development ==

This was mostly just a sideproject of mine, but it's based off of real software I used when I was collecting *Magic: the Gathering* cards actively. This plugin will always be free, which means I'm not making any money off of it, and therefore may or may not be inclined to add new features to it. However, given enough interest, there are a few directions this plugin could go like…

= Premium Extensions =

Game-based extensions that add new features (like additional meta-fields for game-specific information not included in the basic plugin) and game-centric icons that replace the generic text that displays for casting/summoning cost or series.

I'm open to other suggestions for extensions as well from anyone who wants to use this plugin.

**So how will these extensions get made?**

Each add-on extension will likely have some kind of bounty based on how long it would take to develop it. I'll try to throw together some kind of Kickstarter-like donation system, so people can donate toward a particular goal and if enough people donate (or pledge to donate), the add-on gets made.

**How do I request an extension?**

For now you can either open a ticket in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jazzsequence/CCG-Manager/issues) or ping me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/jazzs3quence).
